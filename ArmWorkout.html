            <h2>Arm Workouts</h2>
            <p>Arm workouts are the cornerstone of all workouts, Many non arm workouts indirectly work the arm muscles, like the bench press.
            Arms are a section of the body where it is easy to see results and that is why we love them.

            <h2>The Bicep Curl</h2>
            <img  src="images/DumbellBicepCurl.jpg" alt="Bicep curl" height= "23%" width="23%"/>
                <p>The bicep curl is simple and important. as seen in the image you lift the dumbell only moving your forearm, the rest of your body should be perfectly still. Your back should be straight to reduce movement and injury. repeat this 8 times for 3 sets.

            <h2>The Tricep Dip</h2>
            <img  src="images/TricepDips.jpg" alt="Bicep curl" height= "23%" width="23%"/>
                <p>The Tricep dip, in my opinion, the easiest way to streghten your triceps. All you need is a chair or bench and go to work.
                    To do these, you put your hands on the edge of the chair, your back will be perpendicualar to the to the gound and your legs will be straight streched out as far as u can put them. then using your arms psuh youself, uowards and repeat. repeat 10 times for 3 sets.

            <h2>The Shoulder Press</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5yWaNOvgFCM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>The shoulder press is a known compound workout, Which means it works alot of muscles, mainly in the arms shoulders and back.
                    This workout needs to be done correct as risk of injury is high if done wrong, There is a video above which shows the proper way to do so.
