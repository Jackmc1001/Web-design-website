                <p>Probably the most well known workout, the squat is brilliant because all of the muscles it works, and because of that its a great calorie burner. The squat can be weighted or unweighted. For this demonstration it will be weighted. This is an exercise that needs to be done properly as it has high risk of injury. Your feet need to be apart around shoulder with, Back must be strght at all times. 8 reps for 3 sets

                <p>Dont be fooled, the wall sit is a workout thats as tough as they come. It may be simple on paper, but in practice its very tough. Allyou need for this workout is of course a wall. Stand with you back to the wall and lower yourself until you legs are at a 90 degree angle. Do this for 30 seconds for 3 sets

           <img  src="images/stepup.jpg" alt="Wall Sit" height= "30%" width="30%"/>
                <p>the step up is an easy workout that works up a sweat. It requries more muscles to be used thus burning more caloies. to do this you need a bench or chair. Set 1 foot ont the bench, without jumping slowly lift youself with the power of the leg on the bench. Once up on the bench go back down and repeat. 8 each leg for 3 sets
